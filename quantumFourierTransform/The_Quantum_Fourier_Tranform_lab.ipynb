        "The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a fundamental quantum operation that plays a key role in many quantum algorithms. The QFT is the quantum analogue of the classical Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), which is used in many classical signal processing applications such as audio and image compression.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of quantum computing, the QFT is used in a variety of algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and the Hidden Subgroup Problem algorithm. It is also used in quantum simulations, quantum error correction, and quantum machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The QFT can be implemented using a combination of Hadamard gates and controlled-phase gates. However, the circuit for the QFT can become quite complex as the number of qubits increases, making it challenging to implement in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will use Pennylane to implement the QFT on quantum circuits and compare it to classical DFT.\n",
