Many quantum algorithms and quantum applications use single qubit gates and circuits as components in more complex circuits.\n","\n","Single qubit circuits are also useful for understanding the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement. By studying single qubit circuits, we can gain an intuition for how quantum systems behave and how they can be manipulated to perform quantum operations.\n","\n","In addition, single qubit circuits are often used in quantum error correction and fault tolerance. In these applications, single qubit gates and circuits are used to correct errors and maintain the integrity of the quantum state.\n","\n","Overall, understanding single qubit circuits is a crucial step towards understanding more complex quantum circuits and quantum algorithms, and is essential for developing practical quantum technologies.\n","\n","In this tutorial, we will learn about simple single qubit circuits in Qiskit, how to apply single qubit rotations, and how to represent the state vector of single qubits on the Bloch sphere. We will start by creating a single qubit circuit and adding gates to it. Then, we will run the circuit and see what the output is. We will use a simulator backend to get the statevector of the qubit after running the circuit, and we will visualize the statevector on the Bloch sphere. Finally, we will apply a rotation gate to the qubit, run the circuit again, and visualize the new statevector on the Bloch sphere. This tutorial will provide a basic introduction to single qubit circuits and rotations in Qiskit, and will help you understand how to visualize quantum states using the Bloch sphere.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yqf8xY9mjkdR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["First let us install qislit..."],"metadata":{"id":"qceJ0vKyg2ao"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"TJWFdgu63qdk"},"outputs":[],"source":["#!pip install qiskit qiskit-aer\n","!pip install qiskit[visualization]\n","!pip install qiskit_aer"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["...and import relevant libraries for math, to create quantum circuits and visualizing ket vectors."],"metadata":{"id":"iBfNfnmJPtLp"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import qiskit\n","print(qiskit.__version__)\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import math\n","from math import pi\n","from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile\n","from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector, DensityMatrix\n","from qiskit.visualization import plot_bloch_multivector, plot_histogram\n","from qiskit.primitives import BackendSampler, StatevectorSampler, StatevectorEstimator\n","from qiskit_aer import Aer\n","from qiskit.circuit.library import UnitaryGate"],"metadata":{"id":"WlaquBii35zB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Exercise 1:** Create a quantum circuit object with one qubit using QuantumCircuit.
